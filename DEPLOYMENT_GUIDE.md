2. Drag the `dist` folder from your project
3. Drop it on the page
4. Done! You'll get a URL like: `https://random-name-123.netlify.app`

**OR via CLI:**
```bash
# Login first

netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
```

## ðŸš€ Option 2: Vercel (Also Great)

### Via Web Interface:

## ðŸš€ Option 3: GitHub Pages

If your repository is on GitHub:

npm install -g gh-pages

# Deploy
npm run build
gh-pages -d dist
```

Access at: `https://your-username.github.io/training-matrix`

## ðŸš€ Option 4: Local Testing (No Deploy)

If you have access to a local machine with a browser:

```bash
# Clone your repository
git clone https://github.com/2f6mc94fdw-bot/training-matrix.git
cd training-matrix

# Install and run
npm install
npm run dev

# Open browser to: http://localhost:3000
```

## ðŸš€ Option 5: Simple HTTP Server

For quick local testing:

```bash
# Using Python (if installed)
cd dist
python -m http.server 8080

# OR using Node
npx serve -s dist -l 8080
```

Then access: `http://localhost:8080`

## ðŸ“¦ Pre-built Files Ready

Your `dist` folder is already built and ready to deploy:
- Location: `/home/user/training-matrix/dist/`
- Size: 990KB
- Contains: index.html + assets folder

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Recommended: Netlify Drop

**Easiest method (2 minutes):**

1. Open: https://app.netlify.com/drop
2. Navigate to your `dist` folder in your file explorer
3. Drag the entire `dist` folder onto the page
4. Get your instant URL!

No command line, no authentication needed (for first deploy)!

## âœ… What Happens After Deployment

Once deployed, you can:
- Login with: `admin` / `admin123`
- Test all features in a real browser
- Share the URL with your team
- Access from anywhere

## ðŸ”’ Security Note

The app currently has:
- Hardcoded admin credentials

- LocalStorage for data persistence

For production use, consider adding:
- Proper authentication backend
- Database storage
- HTTPS (automatically provided by Netlify/Vercel)
