## üß™ How to Test in Your Environment

### Option 1: Deploy to a Hosting Service

**Deploy to Netlify (Recommended - Free & Easy):**
```bash
# Install Netlify CLI
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Deploy (from the training-matrix directory)
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
```

This will give you a public URL like: `https://your-site-name.netlify.app`

**Or deploy to Vercel:**
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Deploy
vercel --prod
```

### Option 2: Local Machine Access

If you can download the project to your local machine:

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run dev`
4. Access http://localhost:3000 in your browser

### Option 3: Port Forwarding (If on Remote Server)

From your **local machine**, run:
```bash
ssh -L 3000:localhost:3000 your-username@your-server-address
```

Then access http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

### Option 4: Serve with Static File Server

```bash
# Install a simple HTTP server
npm install -g serve

# Serve the built files
serve -s dist -l 8080

# Access at http://localhost:8080
```

## üöÄ Next Steps

To actually see the application running, you need to:

1. **Deploy it** (Netlify/Vercel - easiest)
2. **Access locally** (download to your machine)
3. **Use port forwarding** (if on remote server)
4. **Use a static server** (serve the dist folder)

The application is **100% functional** - it just needs to be accessed in an environment where you can open a browser.
